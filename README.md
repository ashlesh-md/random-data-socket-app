## Introduction

The Random Point Generator App leverages React Native to create an engaging mobile experience for users who want to explore and visualize random 3D points dynamically.

## Features

- **User Authentication with Firebase:** Secure user authentication using Firebase for a reliable and secure login/signup process.

- **Real-time 3D Point Generation:** Dynamically generates and visualizes random 3D points in real-time for an interactive experience.

- **Intuitive User Interface:** Designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.

- **Secure Login and Signup Functionality:** Implements secure login and signup functionality to protect user data and privacy.

- **Engaging 3D Splash Screen:** An immersive 3D splash screen enhances the app launch experience.

## Optimization Techniques

To ensure optimal performance and maintainable code, the Random Point Generator App incorporates the following optimization techniques:

- **Memoization with `useMemo`:** The app uses `React.memo` to memoize the rendering of components, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance.

- **Reusable Components:** The app follows a component-based architecture, promoting the reuse of components across different parts of the application. This enhances maintainability and reduces redundancy.

- **Efficient WebSocket Communication:** The WebSocket communication for real-time data is optimized to handle points generation efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## WebSocket Server

The Random Point Generator App includes a WebSocket server implemented using Express and express-ws. The server is responsible for sending random 3D points to connected clients in real-time.

The server code is available in the `server.js` file. It establishes a WebSocket endpoint at `/points` and provides an additional endpoint at `/stop` to stop the WebSocket stream.
